# Michele Candido
I’m a Systems Analysis and Development student with a strong passion for technology and digital media. I was born and raised in Porto Alegre, but I am currently living in Tramandaí, RS. I've always been driven by a desire to create, connect and find smart solutions through tech and design, which led me to discover a deep interest in software engineering and development.

Before this, I studied Visual Design (Bachelor) where I learned about creative problem-solving, graphic design, planning, and teamwork. Those experiences still influence my workflow nowadays.

Thanks to my current academic course, I’ve been learning Python and Java, applying them in class projects and challenges. Outside the classroom, I've been exploring JavaScript, HTML, and CSS to build my own original projects, constantly pushing myself as a self-taught learner to grow in the world of web development.
